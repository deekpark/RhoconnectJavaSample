Sample of complete Java back-end application using Spring 3.0 MVC as front end technology and Hibernate 
as backend ORM technology. For this application also uses Maven for build and dependency management and 
MySQL as database to persist the data.
 
This sample is based on excellent tutorial from "Spring 3.0 MVC Series": 
http://viralpatel.net/blogs/2010/11/spring3-mvc-hibernate-maven-tutorial-eclipse-example.html

Steps you need to setup MySQL server. As a MySQL administrator create database 'ContactManager' and 
table 'contacts':  

mysql> create database ContactManager;
mysql> use ContactManager;
mysql> CREATE TABLE CONTACTS
(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    firstname   VARCHAR(30),
    lastname    VARCHAR(30),
    telephone   VARCHAR(15),
    email       VARCHAR(30),
    created     TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

You might also wanted to change 'jdbc.properties', if they are different from project settings:

jdbc.username=root
jdbc.password=


You can run the application using Maven.
In a terminal of the project's root folder issue these commands:

mvn clean
mvn jetty:run

When you see [INFO] Started Jetty Server open a web browser and navigate to URL
